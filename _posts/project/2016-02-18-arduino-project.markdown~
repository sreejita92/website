Arduino Project

Two semesters ago, the project started as the "Kinect Project". Its members made use of the Microsoft Kinect to create a rough design of an educational application. After just one semester, a good amount of progress was made, and a short demo was presented at an IEEE general body meeting. 

The following semester, the members desired to change to a project that could offer students something a little less specific with a great deal more flexibility.  This led to a shift toward work on the Arduino microcontroller kits and a name change to the "Arduino Project".

Currently, the members of this project are interested in creating projects involving user control and I/O. Since most team members have little to no previous experience with the Arduino, meetings involve the team learning a bit of Arduino functionality at a time while having the opportunity to build fun mini-projects each week. After students have gained enough of an understanding on the Arduino, they will come together and form larger, more complex ideas.

At the end of the day, the main purpose of the Arduino Project is to grow with your peers as you learn something new and gain experience in the world of Arduino.
